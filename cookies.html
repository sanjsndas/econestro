                <h2>Cookie Management</h2>
                <p>You have several options to manage cookies on our website:</p>
                
                <h3>6. Browser Settings</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can usually find these settings in the "Options" or "Preferences" menu of your browser. Common browser controls include the ability to delete existing cookies, block all cookies, or set preferences for certain websites. Note that blocking all cookies may affect your ability to use some features of our website.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Cookie Consent Tool</h3>
                <p>Our cookie consent banner allows you to selectively accept or reject different categories of cookies (except essential cookies). You can change your preferences at any time by clicking the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of our website. Your preferences will be remembered for future visits through a cookie.</p>
                
                <h3>8. Third-Party Opt-Outs</h3>
                <p>For third-party cookies used for advertising and analytics, you can often opt out directly with the third-party provider. Many advertising networks offer opt-out mechanisms, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page (aboutads.info) or the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page (optout.networkadvertising.org). These opt-outs are typically cookie-based and will need to be reset if you clear your cookies.</p>
                
                <h3>9. Do Not Track Signals</h3>
                <p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites indicating you don't want to be tracked. Currently, our website doesn't respond to DNT signals, as there's no industry standard for compliance. Instead, we offer granular cookie controls through our consent management tool.</p>
                
                <h3>10. Mobile Device Controls</h3>
                <p>On mobile devices, you may have additional controls in your device's operating system to limit ad tracking. For iOS devices, look for "Limit Ad Tracking" in Settings, and for Android devices, look for "Opt out of Ads Personalization." These controls affect how third-party cookies are used for advertising purposes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-section">
                <h2>Why We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies serve several important functions for our website and services:</p>
                
                <h3>11. Website Functionality</h3>
                <p>Essential cookies allow our website to work properly by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas. Without these cookies, features like shopping carts or secure login would not work correctly. They also help maintain your session as you move between pages, preventing you from having to re-enter information.</p>
                
                <h3>12. User Experience</h3>
                <p>Functional cookies remember your preferences and choices (such as language, region, or login information) to provide you with a more personalized experience. They enable features like remembering items in your cart or maintaining your logged-in status. These cookies can also enable enhanced features like live chat support.</p>
                
                <h3>13. Performance Optimization</h3>
                <p>Performance cookies help us understand how visitors use our website, which pages are most popular, and where users may encounter problems. This information helps us improve the site's performance and user experience. We use aggregated analytics data to identify trends and make informed decisions about site improvements.</p>
                
                <h3>14. Marketing Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>Targeting cookies help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and deliver relevant advertising. They allow us to limit how many times you see an ad and help us understand if our advertising is effective. These cookies may also enable us to show you ads on other sites based on your browsing behavior on our site.</p>
                
                <h3>15. Social Media Integration</h3>
                <p>Social media cookies enable you to share content from our website on social networks and allow social media features to work properly. They may track your browser across other sites to build a profile of your interests. This can affect the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-section">
                <h2>Cookie Duration</h2>
                <p>Cookies have different lifespans depending on their purpose:</p>
                
                <h3>16. Session Cookies</h3>
                <p>Session cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. They are essential for maintaining your session and enabling features like staying logged in as you navigate our site. These cookies don't collect information from your computer and typically store information in the form of a session identification.</p>
                
                <h3>17. Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period specified in the cookie or until you delete them. They enable our website to recognize you when you return and remember your preferences. The duration varies from a few days to several years, depending on the cookie's purpose and your interactions with our site.</p>
                
                <h3>18. First-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>First-party cookies are set by our website domain and can only be read by our site. They are generally used for functionality specific to our website, such as remembering your login details or language preferences. These cookies are typically more secure and privacy-focused than third-party cookies.</p>
                
                <h3>19. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than ours, typically by our partners and service providers. These cookies are used for cross-site tracking, retargeting, and ad-serving. The duration of these cookies is controlled by the third parties that set them, though many provide mechanisms to opt out of tracking.</p>
                
                <h3>20. Supercookies</h3>
                <p>We do not use "supercookies" or other tracking methods that are difficult to detect or remove. All our tracking technologies are standard cookies that can be managed through normal browser settings. We believe in transparent tracking practices and provide clear information about all cookies we use.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-section">
                <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
                <p>Our cookie practices comply with applicable privacy laws:</p>
                
                <h3>21. GDPR Compliance</h3>
                <p>For visitors from the European Union, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements for cookie consent. We obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies and provide clear information about their purposes. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time through our cookie settings.</p>
                
                <h3>22. CCPA Compliance</h3>
                <p>For California residents, we comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) by providing information about cookie-based data collection and offering opt-out mechanisms for the "sale" of personal information. Our cookie consent tool includes options to opt out of tracking cookies used for targeted advertising.</p>
                
                <h3>23. ePrivacy Directive</h3>
                <p>We follow the EU ePrivacy Directive requirements by providing clear and comprehensive information about our use of cookies and obtaining consent before setting non-essential cookies. Our cookie banner appears on first visit and allows users to make granular choices about cookie categories.</p>
                
                <h3>24. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly use cookies to collect personal information from children under 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information and delete any related cookies.</p>
                
                <h3>25. International Transfers</h3>
                <p>Some third-party cookies may involve the transfer of data outside your country of residence. Where this occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses for EU data transfers. More information is available in our Privacy Policy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-section">
                <h2>Cookie Technology Details</h2>
                <p>Understanding the technical aspects of our cookie usage:</p>
                
                <h3>26. HTTP Cookies</h3>
                <p>Standard HTTP cookies are small text files placed on your device by our web server. They contain anonymous unique identifiers and are used to maintain your session and preferences. These cookies are supported by all browsers and can be easily managed through browser settings or our consent tool.</p>
                
                <h3>27. Local Storage</h3>
                <p>We may use HTML5 local storage to store larger amounts of data on your device for functionality purposes (like saving draft forms). Unlike cookies, this data isn't transmitted to the server with each request. You can clear local storage through your browser's developer tools or privacy settings.</p>
                
                <h3>28. Pixel Tags</h3>
                <p>We may use pixel tags (clear GIFs) in conjunction with cookies to track conversions from our marketing campaigns. These tiny invisible images help us understand if our ads are effective without collecting personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it.</p>
                
                <h3>29. Fingerprinting</h3>
                <p>We do not use browser fingerprinting or other covert tracking techniques that cannot be managed through normal privacy controls. All our tracking methods are transparent and can be controlled through our cookie consent tool or standard browser settings.</p>
                
                <h3>30. Secure Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use secure, HTTP-only flags for cookies that contain sensitive information (like authentication tokens). These security measures help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and ensure cookies are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-section">
                <h2>Impact of Disabling Cookies</h2>
                <p>Understanding the consequences of cookie restrictions:</p>
                
                <h3>31. Essential Features</h3>
                <p>If you disable essential cookies, certain features of our website may not work properly. This includes the ability to log in to your account, add items to your cart, or proceed through checkout. Some pages may not display correctly, and you may need to re-enter information more frequently.</p>
                
                <h3>32. Personalization Loss</h3>
                <p>Without functional cookies, our website won't remember your preferences or customized settings. You may need to reset your language, region, or display preferences each time you visit. Personalized recommendations and saved items may not be available.</p>
                
                <h3>33. Analytics Impact</h3>
                <p>Blocking performance cookies means we won't be able to gather data about how you use our site, which limits our ability to improve it. Your visits won't be counted in our analytics, and we won't be able to identify and fix usability issues that might affect your experience.</p>
                
                <h3>34. Advertising Relevance</h3>
                <p>Opting out of targeting cookies means you may see advertising that's less relevant to your interests. You may see the same ads repeatedly, as frequency capping won't work, and the ads won't be tailored based on your browsing behavior on our site.</p>
                
                <h3>35. Social Features</h3>
                <p>Without social media cookies, sharing content to social networks may not work properly. Social media plugins (like Facebook "Like" buttons) may not function, and you may need to manually copy and paste links to share content on social platforms.</p>

                <h3>37. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>We use several third-party services that may set their own cookies, including Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and advertising networks. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We only work with reputable providers who comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>
                
                <h3>38. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>Cookie data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. Persistent cookies have set expiration dates, after which they are automatically deleted. You can manually delete cookies at any time through your browser settings.</p>
                
                <h3>39. Contact for Questions</h3>
                <p>If you have questions about our use of cookies, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@eco-nestro.com or by mail at our physical address. For technical questions about managing cookies, consult your browser's help resources or contact their support team.</p>
                
                <h3>40. Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. When we make significant changes, we'll notify you through a notice on our website or by email (if we have your contact information). Your continued use of our website after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
