                <h3>5. Service Descriptions</h3>
                <p>We strive to accurately describe our services on our website and marketing materials. However, we do not warrant that service descriptions or other content are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Actual service results may vary based on environmental conditions, property characteristics, and other factors beyond our control.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Service Limitations</h3>
                <p>Our services are subject to limitations based on seasonality, weather conditions, and plant availability. Some services may not be available in all areas or at all times. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue services without notice at any time. We shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of services.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Service Scheduling</h3>
                <p>Services are scheduled based on availability and may be subject to change due to weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any schedule changes. You may reschedule services with at least 48 hours notice without penalty, subject to availability.</p>
                
                <h3>8. Property Access</h3>
                <p>You agree to provide our staff with safe and reasonable access to your property for service provision. This includes ensuring gates are unlocked, pets are secured, and any hazards are identified prior to our arrival.

                <h3>9. Service Guarantee</h3>

                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>The following terms apply to all payments for Eco-nestro services:</p>
                
                <h3>10. Pricing</h3>
                <p>All prices are quoted in US dollars and are subject to change without notice. Prices may vary based on property size, condition, and specific service requirements. A final quote will be provided after initial consultation and site evaluation. Taxes and other fees may apply and will be clearly indicated before payment.</p>
                
                <h3>11. Payment Methods</h3>
                <p>We accept major credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, and checks. Payment is due at time of service unless otherwise agreed in writing. Recurring services may be set up with automatic payment for convenience. You authorize us to charge the payment method you provide for all applicable fees.</p>
                
                <h3>12. Deposits</h3>
                <p>Certain services may require a deposit to secure your appointment. Deposits are typically 25-50% of the estimated service cost and will be applied to your final invoice. Deposits are non-refundable if you cancel with less than 72 hours notice, except as required by law.</p>
                
                <h3>13. Late Payments</h3>
                <p>Accounts not paid within 15 days of invoice date will be considered delinquent. Late payments may be subject to interest charges of 1.5% per month (18% annually) or the maximum rate allowed by law. We reserve the right to suspend services for accounts with outstanding balances over 30 days.</p>
                
                <h3>14. Disputes</h3>
                <p>If you dispute any charges, you must notify us in writing within 10 days of the invoice date. We will work with you to resolve any billing disputes in good faith. Unresolved disputes may be submitted to binding arbitration as outlined in these Terms.</p>

                <h3>15. Client Cancellations</h3>

Emergency cancellations due to illness or extreme weather will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                
                <h3>16. Company Cancellations</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule services due to inclement weather, safety concerns, or other circumstances beyond our control.
