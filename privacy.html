                <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
                
                <h3>17. Access and Portability</h3>
                <p>You may request a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used format. We will provide this information within a reasonable timeframe, typically within 30 days of receiving your request. You can access much of your information directly through your account settings.</p>
                
                <h3>18. Correction</h3>
                <p>You may request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data. We encourage you to review and update your account information regularly to ensure it remains accurate. You can update most of your personal information through your account settings or by contacting our support team.</p>
                
                <h3>19. Deletion</h3>
                <p>You may request deletion of your personal data, subject to certain legal exceptions. Upon receiving a valid deletion request, we will remove your personal data from our active systems, though some information may remain in backup archives for legal compliance purposes until those backups are cycled out.</p>
                
                <h3>20. Restriction and Objection</h3>
                <p>You may request restriction of processing or object to certain types of processing, such as direct marketing. If you object to processing based on legitimate interests, we will reassess the balance between our interests and your rights. You can manage many of these preferences through your account settings.</p>
                
                <h3>21. Withdraw Consent</h3>
                <p>Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. This includes opting out of marketing communications, which you can do by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email or adjusting your account preferences.</p>
                
                <h3>22. Non-Discrimination</h3>
                <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. This means we will not deny you services, charge different prices, or provide a different level or quality of services because you exercised any of your privacy rights, unless permitted by applicable laws.</p>
